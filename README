This is the code for CHIRP's internal web applications.  The apps are
hosted on Google's App Engine, under the 'chirpradio' project.

For the chirpradio developer dashboard, go to:

CODING CONVENTIONS
==================

Please follow the conventions outlined in PEP 8.


OVERVIEW OF THE TREE
====================

There are part of the common infrastructure.
  djzango.zip
    Django 1.0.2-final, zipped up.  We never want to change this.
  appengine_django/
    From google-app-engine-django, AppEngine helper & glue code.
  common/
    Code & data shared by all apps.
  django-extras/   
    A tree that is merged into the django namespace.  We put our own
    glue code here.  This should be kept small and simple.
  __init__.py
  main.py
  manage.py
    Launchers for Django.
  settings.py
    Global configuration for Django.
  urls.py
    Main URL file.
  auth/
    Our own custom authentication & account management system.
  media/ext_js/[package name]
    External third-party Javascript packages (like JQuery) live under this
    directory.

These are places where all applications store data.
  media/[application name]/{js, css, img}/
  templates/[application name]/

These are applications that are running in production.
  (None so far)

These are applications that are under development.
  landing_page/
    Where you end up when you go to "/".  Currently a test page.
  volunteers/
    Volunteer tracking.


ADDING A NEW APPLICATION
========================

Every application has a name that looks like this: "landing_page".
Your code lives in a directory with the same name.
Your templates go under the directory templates/[application name].
Your media files go under the directory media/[application name].

All of your URLs are automatically mapped to be under
http://host/volunteers/my/url

To make your URLs visible, you need to:
(1) Update the top-level urls.py to include your urls.
(2) Add your application to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.
  

THIRD-PARTY CODE
================

Some of the files in this directory and all of files under the
appengine_django/ subdirectory are based on rev 81 of the
google-app-engine-django Subversion repository.

All files in django.zip are taken from Django 1.0.2-final.  It was
constructed by running the following commands:

zip -r django.zip django/__init__.py django/bin django/core \
                  django/db django/dispatch django/forms \
                  django/http django/middleware django/shortcuts \
                  django/template django/templatetags \
                  django/test django/utils django/views

zip -r django.zip django/conf -x 'django/conf/locale/*'

These commands were taken from
