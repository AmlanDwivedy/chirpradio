			  Auth System Notes
			  -----------------


Passwords
---------

Passwords must be non-empty strings.  Other than that, no restrictions
are placed on the length or the nature of passwords.

We never store plaintext passwords.  Instead, we store the value

   [salt] + SHA1( [salt] + [plaintext] )

where [salt] is a nondeterministically-generated value between 0x0000
and 0xffff (inclusive).  The salt and SHA1 hash are represented as
sequences of hex digits.

The salt is included in order to increase the cost of mounting a
dictionary attack against a leaked list of hashed passwords.


Security Tokens
---------------

Security tokens are formed by AES-encrypting and HMAC-signing a string
that contains two pieces of information:
 * A user's email address
 * A timestamp (measured in seconds since the Unix epoch).  The token
   expires two hours after this time.

When a user successfully logs in, we return a security token in a
cookie.  We then allow any request that presents a valid and unexpired
token to access the system with that user's rights.

We periodically reset the user's cookie with a freshly-generated
security token.  This prevents them from being logged off due to the
previously-granted token expiring.
