Using Mercurial
---------------

To create a new local repository:
% hg clone http://chirpradio.googlecode.com/hg/ chirpradio

To pull updates into your local repository:
% hg pull

To push your changes into the master repository:
% hg push https://<your username>@chirpradio.googlecode.com/hg/

To get your GoogleCode.com password (needed to push changes):
http://code.google.com/hosting/settings

Guide", by Bryan O'Sullivan.

Running Locally
---------------

To start up a local server, run
% python manage.py runserver

You can reach your local server by going to http://localhost:8000/
in your web browser.

If you are running this server on a different computer, you need to run
the server with
% python manage.py [hostname or IP address]
instead.  This tells Django that it should accept remote connections.

To run all unit tests:
% python manage.py test

You can also use
% python manage.py test [application name]
to only run a single application's tests.



Adding a New Application
------------------------

Every application has a name that looks like this: "landing_page".
Your code lives in a directory with the same name.
Your templates go under the directory templates/[application name].
Your media files go under the directory media/[application name].

All of your URLs are automatically mapped to be under
http://host/volunteers/my/url

To make your URLs visible, you need to:
(1) Update the top-level urls.py to include your urls.
(2) Add your application to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.


Users and Authentication
------------------------

The chirpradio applications use custom middleware to enforce access
controls.  It will automatically take care of details like blocking
inactive users or redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.

* Roles

Roles are a light-weight substitute for the standard Django auth module's
notion of groups.

The list of valid roles is hard-wired into auth/roles.py, so adding a
new role requires an updated version of the app to be pushed into
production.

* Access Policy

With only a very few exceptions, all of the URLs that are part of the
chirpradio applications are only accessible to signed-in users.  If an
unauthenticated user tries to visit such a URL, they will be
redirected to a login page, and then redirected back to the
originally-requested page after they have successfully signed in.
This behavior is controlled by custom middleware defined in
auth/middleware.py.

Access can be further restricted based on role using the decorators
defined in auth/decorators.py.  For example, this is how to define a
view that is only accessible to a user who has the role "volunteer
coordinator":

    from auth import roles
    from auth.decorators import require_role

    @require_role(roles.VOLUNTEER_COORDINATOR)
    def my_view(request):
        ... etc ...

* User Information

Our User object is defined in auth/models.py.  It is similar, but not
identical, to the stock Django User object.

For any incoming HttpRequest, the user attribute is automatically populated
with the logged-in user's User object.

    def my_hello_world_view(request):
        return HttpResponse('Hello %s!' % request.user)

Users are keyed on their email addresses:
    some_user = User.get_by_email(email_addr)

However, users are allowed to change their email address.
Applications should not put them in the datastore or otherwise assume
that they are invariant.

* Unit Testing

To simplify unit testing, the CHIRP authentication system is
integrated with Django's django.test.client module.  You can use the
login method to test against fake users with various characteristics.

    from django.test.client import Client

    my_client = Client()
    # You can set any of the User object's attributes here.
    my_client.login(email="test@test.com", roles=[role1, role2])
    response = my_client.get("/some/page/to/test")
